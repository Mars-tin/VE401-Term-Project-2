## Abstract
David Spiegelhalter and Arthur Barnett's *London Murder* analyses murder cases in London between 2004 and 2007. Also, *Washington Post* provides a database recording the occurrence of fatal police shootings. *Washington Post* claims that there have been 270 citizen killed by police shooting since 2019, as of March 15th.

In this project, we are going to use data above, applying mathematical methods we obtained in ve401, to do some data analysis. We will summarize the data sources and conclude how the term "fatal police shooting" is used here. We will use *Mathematica* to create a histogram of numbers of fatal police shooting from 2015 to 2018. We will test the hypothesis that the number of police shootings in the US between 2015 and 2018 follows a Poisson distribution. We will test whether there is evidence that the average number of police shootings depends on the weekday. We will calculate the (1-alpha)-confidence interval of parameter k. We will check whether fatal police shooting data between January and March in 2019 follows a Poisson distribution and calculate the value of $k$. We will obtain 95% prediction intervals for the number of mass shootings in 2019 based on the data for 2015 to 2018, and plot the result.

## Key Words
Fatal police shootings, Poisson distribution, Confidence interval, Prediction interval, Mathematica.
